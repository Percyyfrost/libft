 # libft

## Building a Foundation in C

libft is a collection of re-implemented C standard library functions and additional utility functions designed for use within the 42 curriculum. This project challenges students to create their own library, fostering a deeper understanding of:

- Memory management
- String manipulation
- Basic algorithms
- Function design
- Library creation

Why re-invent the wheel?

42's unique approach to learning emphasizes hands-on experience and problem-solving. By constructing these functions from scratch, you'll gain a deeper understanding of C's core concepts and develop a toolkit for future projects.

## Contents

Mandatory Part:

- Memory Functions: `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memccpy`, `ft_memmove`, `ft_memchr`, `ft_memcmp`
- String Functions: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strlcpy`, `ft_strlcat`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_strrchr`, `ft_strnstr`, `ft_strncmp`, `ft_atoi`, `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalnum`, `ft_isascii`, `ft_isprint`, `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower`

Bonus Part:

- Additional Functions: `ft_strdup`, `ft_calloc`, `ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strtrim`, `ft_split`, `ft_itoa`, `ft_strmapi`, `ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`, `ft_putendl_fd`, `ft_putnbr_fd`

## Usage

1. Include the header:

   ```c
   #include "libft.h"
   ```

2. Compile with the library:

   ```bash
   gcc your_program.c -L. -lft
   ```
